## Install

Currently this is a standalone script that cannot be installed and is only used as a case study.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development servers. One server handles gathering and caching the data while the other is a NextJS server that serves the site.

When debugging data gathering, you can use the `pnpm dev:data --debug` command to start the data server in debug mode.
