# Documenting Design Systems In NextJS

This repo is an example of how to document a system in NextJS.

## Features

♻️ Fast Refresh for everything

🤖 Component, hook, and utility doc generation

🖼 Server rendered live code examples

🕹 Interactive playground using Monaco Editor

🐇 Quick links to source code

📝 MDX for mixing Markdown and JSX

## Development

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

This will start the development servers. One server handles gathering and caching the data while the other is a NextJS server that serves the site.

When debugging data gathering, you can use the `yarn dev:data --debug` command to start the data server in debug mode.
